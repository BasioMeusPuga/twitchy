# twitchy
## livestreamer wrapper for twitch.tv

This script hopefully helps the needs of the discerning consumer who wants to watch Twitch, hates the CPU utilization of having a browser running, and has only a terminal (and the 3 or so required accessory programs) handy.
Options are in the first few lines of the script.

What you get with the script:
* Moderately severe meme support
* Tracking of most watched channels
* Really fast bash multi-threading using nothing but & (Kappa)
* A cure for pattern baldness (Keepo? This feels like a Keepo)

Usage: twitchy --help
