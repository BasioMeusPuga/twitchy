# twitchy
livestreamer wrapper for twitch.tv

This script hopefully fulfills the needs of the discerning git cloner who wants to watch Twitch, hates the CPU utilization of having a browser running, and has only a terminal (and the 3 or so required accessory programs) handy.
*Requires livestreamer, sqlite, toilet*

What you get with the script:
* Moderately severe meme support
* Tracking of most watched channels
* Really fast bash multi-threading using nothing but & (Kappa)
* A cure for pattern baldness (Keepo? This feels like a Keepo.)
* Flippable switches in the first few lines of the script
* The ability to display alternate names for games / streamers. If your happiness is somehow contingent upon displaying "Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft" as "Wizard Poker", well, you've come to the right place.

Usage: 

    twitchy -h
